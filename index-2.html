                            <p class="leader-p leader-p1">Most managers get into leadership positions because of their
                                professional skills.
                                However, it is a well-known fact that good technical skills do not automatically equal
                                the
                                leadership
                                qualities required. After all, managers also need to know how to lead and support
                                employees
                                in
                                the best possible
                                way. This includes competencies such as clear communication, effective time management,
                                and
                                respectful
                                manners. Only with those skills will you be able to create a framework within which
                                employees
                                can be
                                successful.

                            <p class="leader-p leader-p2">Good managers take responsibility for their decisions. They
                                listen
                                and are able to
                                motivate employees and inspire them with their own vision. They are leaders that people
                                like
                                to
